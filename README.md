# fatbird

Playground to learn Korge.

This doesn't do much right now. You can control your bird as follows:

* Left arrow: run left
* Right arrow: run right
* Space: start flapping. Press Space a lot.
* Space + arrow key: jump

Some sort of fruit things fall from the sky. They don't do anything.

## Build & Run

In a JVM:

```
./gradlew runJvm
```

Web:

```
./gradlew runJs
```

Prepare for web deployment:

```
./gradlew jsBrowserDistribution
```

## TODO

Change app name (page name) to fatbird.
